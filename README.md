# Language client for OpenFL

An implementation of the [language server protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), originally created for [Moonshine IDE](https://moonshine-ide.com/). Specifically, implements the client side of the client/server relationship, where a client is an editor or IDE that wishes to provide code intelligence features.

This language client is written in [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) and targets the [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/) library.
